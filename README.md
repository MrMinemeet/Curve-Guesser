# Curve Guesser
This repository holds the source code for the "educational" game "_Curve Guesser_" for the course "_Educational Game Design_" in WS2023/24 at the [Johannes Kepler University](https://www.jku.at/) in Linz.

# Project Outline
## Target Group
14-16 year old, last year of secondary school and middle-school

## Subject / Topic
Math, i.e., plotting of functions

## Background
Understanding functions in math, at the beginning, is not that easy. Most students
find it easy when having something that visualizes them instead of just looking at a
plain mathematically written function.

## What problem(s) are you addressing
The parameters of functions are all doing different things, e.g., shifting on the x-axis, changing the direction of the graph or flattening the curve.
The goal of this game is to learn how these parameters work in a playful way through increasingly difficult levels, where players have to collect points on a coordinate plane by plotting the function right.

## Educational concepts in the project
Explanation of what each parameter is changing for the specific function

## Milestones / Possible barriers
### Milestones:
* 7.11.2023 - Project Proposal
* 1.12.2023 - Basic prototype with a level and working parameter guessing
* 15.12.2023 - A few levels with increasing difficulty
* 16.1.2023 - Prototype ready for playtesting
* 23.1.2024 - Finished game with adjustments from playtesting

### Possible barriers:
* Calculation of Score doesn't work as intended
* Balancing of the difficulty

## Artefact(s)
* Curve Guesser Game
* Knowledge about parameters of functions
* Project Proposal
* Informal study conducted with the help of teachers
* Source-Code of the Game
* Project Presentation Slides

## Playtesting / Evaluation
Ask ex-teachers of ours to conduct a small, informal study about the game

# Teachers Manual
* Install the game on lab your PCs or let the students install it (or use the online version when available)
* Tell the students which track to play (in the future you can provide them a code with which they can only play the predefined levels)
* The levels explain the parameters and what they do to the graph of the function
* Maybe explain the concepts in class beforehand anyway, so they have a clue what they are doing
* They need to know the value of pi up to 3.14 for the sine levels.
* In the future there will be automatic point tracking in a teacher tool for the curve guesser
* Based on the scores you can decide which topics to repeat or to emphasise later
